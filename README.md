## Vaccinated people per target group (EBU)

The animation shows the percentage of vaccinated people in the age group of over 80 years. First animation has the data for single dose and the second is for fully vaccinated.

1) First dose administered by country code
2) Percentage of population over 80 years of age who has received first dose
3) Full vaccination administered by country code
4) Percentage of population over 80 years of age who has received full vaccine

The data is sourced from ECDC. It might be that more countries have started the vaccinations but their data is not available via these sources. Spain data for over 80 years of age who have received vaccinations comes from Ministerio de Sanidad.

The following countries provide data on their own but are not reporting it to ECDC.
